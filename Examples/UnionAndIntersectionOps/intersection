# This code demonstrates a custom intersection method for "sets" in discrete math set theory
# please correct me: ebleier4@gmail.com

def custom_intersection(list1, list2):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the intersection
    intersection = []

    # Iterate through the elements of the first list
    for item in list1:
        # Check if the item is also in the second list and not already in the intersection list
        if item in list2 and item not in intersection:
            # Add the item to the intersection list
            intersection.append(item)

    return intersection

# Example usage:
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list2 = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

result = custom_intersection(list1, list2)
print(result)
